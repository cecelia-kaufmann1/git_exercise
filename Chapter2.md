Francisco had always known he was a dancer.
Ever since birth.
He had tangoed out of the womb, shimmied into training school.
He sashayed on his walks, and, upon seeing breakdancers dancing on the sidewalk, never missed a chance to join in.
As he grew, so did his talent.
He honed his craft, and learned more about the history and context behind his moves.
He also learned just how unusual his passion was -- there weren't many other dancing dogs to look to for guidance or support.
But he made his own path, as a dancing, talking dog.
