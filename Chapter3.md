Francisco wants to dance but its owner says no, it's not right for a dog to dance. 
So Francisco tells his owner that if he is not allowed to dance then he will run away from home.
The owner says "I don't care, you can run away if you want!"
So Francisco packs his bags, takes a bone, and runs away from the owner's house.
