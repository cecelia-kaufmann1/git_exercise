Chapter 1: A Talking Dog?
Francisco the dog was having the best day of his life. 
He has just come back from the store with his owner and had gotten a new dog collar! 
It was a brilliant blue, with crystals in the shape of stars. 
He was so happy. 
Once he got home, he grabbed his slipper for his owner and they sat by the fire, admiring the wonderful day they had just experienced. 
In the background, there was some David Breubeck playing and his owner sat in the chair humming along. Francisco was happy and wished he could hum along. 
Suddenly, his owner asked him he wanted dinner!
Oh man! 
Dinner sounds great! 
Francisco wanted to tell his owner! 
Suddenly, he spoke "Yes please! That sounds so good!"
Oh my gosh! He talked! 
Wow!
His owner was shocked and fainted on sight.
