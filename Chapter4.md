Taking his hand into his paw, Francisco taught his owner how to dance. 
They started off slow, but then started leaping around the room. 
It was a dance straight from a musical. 
Soon, others joined in. 
The birds surrounded them, and the neighbors started dancing in the streets. 
There was no music but Francisco's own inner rhythm, and he shared it with the rest of the world. 
At the end of their dance, his owner looks to him and smiles. 
"Francisco, I am so sorry I stopped you from dancing." 
"I now see how powerful dance is and I won't stop you any more."
Francisco leapt up and down, twirling and dancing. 
And from then on, he spread joy to everyone with his dancing.
